This is an incomplete implementation of Lazy K - only 'ski parsing is
done currently.

Lazy K programs live in the same timeless Platonic realm as mathematical
functions, what the Unlambda page calls "the blessed realm of the pure untyped
lambda calculus."

There is no special syntax for IO, Lazy K programs get their input (from stdin)
as a list of church numerals and create a list of these, which is converted to
8-bit characters as output of the computation, 256 is serving as EOF.
